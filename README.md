# NabaisJS
## What is this?

#### This is an attempt to replicate the whole AngularJS framework. I called it nabaisjs because Nabais is my name (creative, I know ;))

Anywat, this is a part of my study on how to become a better programmer, I took the [watch and code](https://watchandcode.com/) course and the study eventually stumbles on trying to replicate the Angular framework by studying the +1000 pages book by Tero Parviainen. 
Tero explains the big picture of the framework and then goes into small detail about it, decomposing every bit of code there is. He did a great job on this book, implementing it always with the Test Driven Development, by creating a new test case to cover what we want the framework to cover.

## About the book:

### Build Your Own AngularJS

This repository contains the AngularJS implementation built during the course of the book [Build Your Own AngularJS](http://teropa.info/build-your-own-angular), as well as the errata for the book.

#### Code

To make following along easier, commits are ordered to match the order of events in the book. Each commit message references the corresponding section title in the book. Note that this means the history of this repository may change as the book is revised.

There is also a tag for each chapter, pointing to the state of the codebase at the end of that chapter.

#### Errata

The [Issues](https://github.com/teropa/build-your-own-angularjs/issues) setion of this repository contains the book's errata. 

If you find bugs, typos, mistakes, or other issues that should be improved, I would love to hear about it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
